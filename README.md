# Getting Started Guide
[I wrote a second guide just for Mac Users](https://medium.com/@kyleking/microduino-and-mac-harmony-e738b8d7cc2) and this is the companion resource

## New to Arduino?
1. [Download as Zip](https://github.com/KyleKing/Microduino-IDE/archive/master.zip)
2. Open arduino-1.0.6-macosx and move the arduino.app file into your application folder
3. From the applications folder, open Arduino and check for the Microduino boards:

4. Then install the drivers below:

### Drivers
> Microduino needs a special driver [available here](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) or use the one downloaded with the repository

1. From the unzipped folder, select the "drivers" folder and double click the .dmg to install
2. Once done, restart your computer
3. It should work from here! Here is what my serial port connection looks like:
