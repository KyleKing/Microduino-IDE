## Get Started
1. [Download the Project as Zip](https://github.com/KyleKing/Microduino-IDE/archive/master.zip)

3. Find your Arduino IDE and right click to show package contents:

## Drivers
> Microduino needs a special driver [available here](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) or use the one downloaded with the repository

1. From the unzipped folder, select the "drivers" folder and double click the .dmg to install
2. Once done, restart your computer
3. It should work from here! Here is what my serial port connection looks like:
