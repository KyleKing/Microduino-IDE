> Already have the Arduino IDE or the former guide not working?

## Get Started
1. [Download the Project as Zip](https://github.com/KyleKing/Microduino-IDE/archive/master.zip)
2. If you haven't already, download and install Arduino 1.0.X: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software (Quick Link: [Mac OS X](http://arduino.cc/download.php?f=/arduino-1.0.6-macosx.zip))
3. Find your Arduino IDE and right click to show package contents: ![Image](Guide Images/1.png)
4. From the unzipped folder, open the "DIY Modification" folder and move the "microduino" folder into the arduino folder as shown: ![Image](Guide Images/2.png)

## Drivers
> Microduino needs a special driver [available here](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) or use the one downloaded with the repository

1. From the unzipped folder, select the "drivers" folder and double click the .dmg to install
2. Once done, restart your computer
3. It should work from here! Here is what my serial port connection looks like: ![Image](Guide Images/4.png)
